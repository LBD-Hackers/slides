				<section>
					<p>This tutorial is part of a series in the <a href="./LBD-school_overview.html">Linked Building Data (LBD) School</a> 🏫</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">The slides are quite detailed and text-heavy as they are supposed to be read rather than presented.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">As I have been using the technologies for a while there might be topics that I take for granted and therefore skip over too fast. Please let me know if this is the case! 🙏</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Also, since this is something I do in my freetime, please support me by buying me a coffee 🤗☕💙</p>

					<h2>Linked Building Data? 🤔</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Linked Building Data (LBD) encapsulates all the ontologies that are being developed and maintained by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/">W3C Linked Building Data Community Group</a></p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">They are an alternative to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-primer/">Web Ontology Language (OWL)</a> version of <a href="https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/industry-foundation-classes/">IFC</a> (ifcOWL) that are easier to understand, extend and query 👌</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">...but before we can dig into the content of these we will need to learn the basics. So jump to next slide and we will get to it! 💪🏃💨</p>
				</section>

			<!-- Linked Data -->
			<section>

				<section>
					<h2>Linked Data</h2>
					<p>The concept of Linked Data was <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData">coined in 2006</a> by sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, and is therfore not entirely new 👴👵</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">It basically refers to a set of best practices for publishing structured data on the Web</p>
					
					<style>
						.cap-ld cap:after {
							content: "¹https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData";
						}
					</style>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Linked Data Principles 🤓</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Use URIs <span class="note">(Uniform Resource Identifiers)</span> as names for things</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Use HTTP URIs <span class="note">(web addresses)</span> so that people can look up those names 👀</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF, SPARQL) <span class="note">(more on this later)</span> 💡</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things 🔭🧭🗺️</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>A network of resources that are interlinked and identified by web addresses.</p> 
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Beware that you will often see resorces that are described in a namespace that doesn't really exist <span class="note">(e.g. https://example.com/my-resource).</span> This is not preferred but yet perfectly okay in order to learn and get started. 🩹</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Also note that not all linked data needs to be open data. You can restrict the access to it 🚦🦺</p>
				</section>

			</section>

			<!-- RDF -->
			<section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>The Resource Description Framework</h2>
					<p>As the name reveils, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/">RDF</a> is a framework and not a format. It includes the terminology you need to describe Linked Data resources <span class="note">(e.g. the type of resource, its attributes and its relationships to other resources)</span>.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">This is all done by creating statements: so-called "triples".</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./static/images/SPO.svg"></section>

        		<section data-background-image="./static/images/SPO2.svg"></section>

				<section data-background-iframe="./static/interactive/spo-graph/index.html?file=rdf-intro01"></section>

				<section>
					<p>Multiple triples form a graph if the object of one triple matches the subject of another</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">This is often referred to as a "Knowledge Graph"</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-iframe="./static/interactive/spo-graph/index.html?file=rdf-intro02"></section>

				<section>
					<p>Predicates that connect resources are called <span class="coded">"object properties"</span></p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up"><span class="coded">"has_window"</span> and <span class="coded">"adjacent_element"</span> from the previous graphs are examples of object properties</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>RDF also describes simple properties that point to an object which is simply a literal value. Those are called <span class="coded">"datatype properties"</span></p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-iframe="./static/interactive/spo-graph/index.html?file=rdf-intro03"></section>

				<section>
					<p>As a last thing, RDF allows you to classify a thing by assigning one or more types to it.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-iframe="./static/interactive/spo-graph/index.html?file=rdf-intro04"></section>

				<section>
					<p>Adding classes to things provide a better way for others to understand your dataset. And for computers!</p>
					<p>You and I could probably deduce that <span class="coded">Wall_002</span> is a Wall, but now it is explicitly stated.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>That's it! Now you know the basic principles of RDF! 🥳🎉</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Oh, not too fast! The Linked Data principles state that we should use HTTP URIs as names for things, so actually it looks more like shown on next slide... 😱🤯</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-iframe="./static/interactive/spo-graph/index.html?file=rdf-intro05"></section>

				<section>
					<p>But don't worry! With the use of prefixes, it will look more like this 😌</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-iframe="./static/interactive/spo-graph/index.html?file=rdf-intro06"></section>

				<section>
					<p>The prefixes are abbreviations for the full URI so:</p>
					<p><span class="coded">inst:Wall_002</span>&nbsp; = &nbsp;<span class="coded">https://my-company.com/Wall_002</span></p>
					<p><span class="coded">inst:Space_013</span>&nbsp; = &nbsp;<span class="coded">https://my-company.com/Space_013</span></p>
					<p><span class="coded">ont:has_window</span>&nbsp; = &nbsp;<span class="coded">https://my-ontology.com#has_window</span></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>In the example we use two prefixes (<span class="coded">inst:</span> and <span class="coded">ont:</span>) and therefore these refere to our instance namespace and the ontology namespace.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">...and this brings us to the concepts ABox and TBox.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">TBox is the "terminology layer" <span class="note">(i.e. the dictionaries)</span> where predicates and classes are defined. These can later be used by various people to describe something. 📙</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">ABox is our "assertions layer" <span class="note">(i.e. the instance data)</span> where we make actual statements about the world by using the TBox.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>It is common to see multiple ontologies to describe one dataset. This is one of the absolute strengths about Linked Data. That it can be both an <span class="coded">ifc:Building</span> as defined by <a href="https://www.buildingsmart.org/">buildingSMART</a>, an <span class="coded">citygml:Building</span> as described by <a href="https://www.ogc.org/">OGC</a> and a <a href="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Building"><span class="coded">dbpedia:Building</span></a> referring to Wikipedias description of a building.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">In LBD we would typically at least describe it as a <a href="https://w3id.org/bot#Building"><span class="coded">bot:Building</span></a>, but more on this later.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Also the instance data can be distributed so part of the data can reside on one server and other parts on another.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Thereby there is a huge decentralization potential in the technologies that we will hopefully cover in a later class! 🚀🚀🚀</p>
				</section>

			<!-- RDF vs tables -->
			<section>

				<section>
					<h2>RDF vs. tables</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Most of us are used to storing information in spreadsheets <span class="note">(or relational databases (RDBs) for the more advanced)</span>, but in RDF we use a graph structure. So how do those compare?</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Let's take a look at a very simple table example to find out!</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./static/images/RDF-en-simple-01.svg"></section>

				<section>
					<p>From an RDF perspective we see too subjects. One for each data row. And they are even identified with an ID.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./static/images/RDF-en-simple-02.svg"></section>

				<section>
					<p>Each column contains a statement about those subjects and the predicate value is given by the column header.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./static/images/RDF-en-simple-03.svg"></section>

				<section>
					<p>The value of the subject-predicate pair can then be found in the cell.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./static/images/RDF-en-simple-04.svg"></section>

				<section data-background-image="./static/images/RDF-en-simple-05.svg"></section>

				<section>
					<p>And with RDF we can combine table data as long as we can find a common identifier for the rows.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">For example, we could have another table with middle names.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./static/images/RDF-en-simple-06.svg"></section>

				<section>
					<p>It's not a problem that there is no middle name for Alexander. RDF builds on an open world assumption meaning that if we have the information that's great and if we don't that's also alright. Then Alexanders middle name is simply unknown to us.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">In RDBs it's common to have dedicated tables that deal with many-to-many relationships. These are also easily translated.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./static/images/RDF-en-simple-07.svg"></section>

				<section>
					<p>So now we also understand the difference and similarities between RDF and tables. And you can probably see how this data structure will save us for a ton of null values. 😃</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">And compared to RDBs there is the benefit that the data model makes sense from a logical perspective and not only from a data management perspective. This benefit will be more obvious when we start to query the datasets later!</p>
				</section>

			</section>



			<!-- RDF serializations -->
			<section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>RDF Serializations</h2>
					<p>This is a more advanced topic for those that are familiar with XML or JSON.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">You can press the right arrow to skip this section, but if you're up for it, hit the down arow! 💪</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Let's first take a look at what RDF looks like in the simplest of all serializations called <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/">NTriples</a>.</p>

					<p>This syntax is incredibly simple and super fast for computers to read.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Triples are stated in their full length and a dot indicates the end of a triple.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">However, for humans it is impossible to read and it takes up a lot of space!</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>The Terse RDF Triple Language <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a> simplifies this a whole lot by introducing some syntactic sugar.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">All this sugar is not covered here, but part of it is since this is also the syntax used in queries. Let's start by defining the prefixes as described in previous section.</p>

					<p>RDF can also be serialized as XML and JSON. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">RDF/XML</a> will not be covered <span class="note">(who uses XML anyways?)</span>, but the new cool kid on the block <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON-LD</a> will for sure.</p>

					<p>Like Turtle JSON-LD can have many shapes and forms. The simplest form is the expanded version .</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">JSON-LD is just JSON but it adds some special keys like <span class="coded">@id</span> to define the subject and <span class="coded">@type</span> to assign <span class="coded">rdf:type</span>.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Similarly to NTriples, the expanded JSON-LD uses the full URIs. Since RDF allows for multiple assignments of classes or any other value for that matter, the value of any key is always an array.</p>

					<p>By stating a <span class="coded">@context</span> and use the concept of compaction it is possible to simplify this tremendously.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">The <span class="coded">@graph</span> component of the result presents all our resources in a flat list.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">JSON-LD comes with tools to change between these representations on the fly which is a really strong tool. In a later tutorial we might take a look at framing!</p>
