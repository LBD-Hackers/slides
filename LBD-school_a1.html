					<p class="fragment fade-up">The slides are quite detailed and text-heavy as they are supposed to be read rather than presented.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">As I have been using the technologies for a while there might be topics that I take for granted and therefore skip over too fast. Please let me know if this is the case! üôè</p>

					<h2>The many forms of JSON-LD</h2>

				<section>
					<p>All the following examples express the exact same thing: The fact that resource <b class="code">https://ex.com/a</b> is a <b class="code">bot:Building</b>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Compaction and Expansion</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<div class="row down-5" style="opacity: 0.8">
						<p>The below example is the expanded version of the fact.</p>
						<pre><code data-trim class="json">
							[
								{
									"@id": "https://ex.com/a",
									"@type": [ "https://w3id.org/bot#Building" ]
								}

						</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">This is the simplest form of JSON-LD and it will always look the same.</p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment fade-up">It's an array containing JSON-LD objects</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-up">The <b>@id</b> specifies the subject with its full URI</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-up">The <b>@type</b> specifies a specific predicate (rdf:type) and the value of predicates is always returned as a list since as per definition, there can be multiple values of a predicate.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<div class="row down-5" style="opacity: 0.8">
						<p>Let's extend it with a datatype property.</p>
						<pre><code data-trim class="json">

				<section>
					<div class="row down-5" style="opacity: 0.8">

								}
							]
						</code></pre>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<div class="row down-5" style="opacity: 0.8">
						<p>We can also use the special <b>@language</b> property to specify a language.</p>

						</code></pre>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<div class="row down-5" style="opacity: 0.8">
						<p>We can also extend it with an object property instead by using the <b>@id</b> property and thereby indicate that it is a reference to a URI.</p>
						<pre><code data-trim class="json">

					<p>The examples you have seen so far introduce the basic principles in JSON-LD. But one of the main strengths of JSON-LD is that it can change form so it fits a specific purpose.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Let's continue with the below expanded example and make it more compact and simple to read. We use the below example for this:</p>
					<pre><code data-trim class="json">
						[
							{
								"@id": "https://ex.com/a",
								"@type": [ "https://w3id.org/bot#Building" ],
								"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label": [{
									"@value": "My Building"
								}],
								"https://example.com#numberOfStoreys": [{
									"@value": "2",
									"@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer"
								}],
								"https://w3id.org/bot#hasStorey": [
									{
										"@id": "https://ex.com/b"
									},
									{
										"@id": "https://ex.com/c"
									}
								]
							},
							{
								"@id": "https://ex.com/b",
								"@type": [ "https://w3id.org/bot#Storey" ],
								"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label": [{
									"@value": "Level 1"
								}]
							},
							{
								"@id": "https://ex.com/c",
								"@type": [ "https://w3id.org/bot#Storey" ],
								"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label": [{
									"@value": "Level 2"
								}]
							}
						]
					</code></pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>We can compact the JSON-LD by specifying a <b>@context</b> for it. So first we specify a <b>@base</b> URI for the namespace in which the instances belong.</p>
					<pre><code data-trim class="json">
						{
							"@context": {
								"@base": "https://ex.com/"
							}
						}
					</code></pre>
